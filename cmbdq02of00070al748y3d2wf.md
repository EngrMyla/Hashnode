Today, I just created this blog website.  
  
I am very happy with my output. I am proud of myself for having accomplished this in 7 hours.  
  
This is just the beginning of my long-sought journey: to be an expert in my field Data and AI. All of my learnings, I will document here.  
  
I am thankful for all that happened thus far. Every single win and failure, pride and disappointment, isolation and collaboration, had lead me to this crossroad.  
  
I know there is still a lot to learn and improve upon, I even am convinced that most fresh grads are better than me in CS/IT.  
  
But I will continuously exert effort and work hard until I am confident enough that I am qualified enough to teach tech to people. To be honest, I felt inspired by the GDC Build with AI event I attended yesterday, quietly asking myself, can I be a lecturer for events like this in the future?  
  
I know my younger self will be so happy and elated if she knew I could be a speaker for such big and important events… My teenage self knows I could always do incredible accomplishments of this magnitude.  
  
I am doing all of this for me, and for the younger Miles who always have remained strong to survive so I could, the present, older, and much capable Miles get a chance of living a much better life. I will be consistent with my learning and diligent with my work, believing that I am doing this also for a cause greater than self-preservation - my survival-mode has ended quite a while.  
  
To the future Myla, I believe you can do it, because I am locking in.  
  
When we get there, please treat me a pizza. Make a promise...
