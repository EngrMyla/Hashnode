And why my coleagues were able to present outputs more eagerly than I do:

I am trying to deliver a 'perfect data set', which is too much to expect from a fully on-prem DW/DS filled with couple of thousands of tables with zero data documentation and governance in all 30 years of operation...

I am not even a perfectionist myself so IDK what lead me to this point. Probably I trusted myself way too much? Probably I am trying to prove I am "one of the best data engineers they had"? (I am still on probation and this is my 4th month here)

The company is fine and has continued to prosper over the decades without much data engineering. They just looked at the big numbers and made decisions based of it intuitively.

Then here I am, just spent hours today looking for the excess 0.4$ from a total revenue of 40Million$ from a report I broke down to a FactTable. Mathematically, this is just peanuts. I should have let it go and used my time effectively on other things.

I am letting go of this perfectionism.

I want to get regularized in this company. I really, really want to.
